# Day-of-the-Week-Calculator
This program is a day of the week calculator which is based on the famous "Doomsday Algorithm".
It takes in a date in MM/DD/YYYY form and outputs the day of the week that that particular day falls on.
The date argument can be put into the command line with the -d flag:
ex: python dowc.py -d 12/31/1986
Or it can be entered after running dowc.py through a user input prompt.
I will eventually add a GUI to this program, perhaps using the tkinter module. 
Note: With sufficient practice, it is possible to memorize this algorithm and solve for the day of the week for any date in your head!
